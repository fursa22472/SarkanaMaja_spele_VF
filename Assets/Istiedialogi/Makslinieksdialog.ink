"Ah, a curious wanderer! You’ve stumbled upon the last haven of real creativity."

+ [What are you doing? Why all the paint?]
   "I’m creating, obviously! This isn’t just paint on canvas; it’s a connection to something deeper. But I doubt you’d get it. Only those who truly understand art can see it."
   -> ExploreBranch

+ [It looks like a mess. Why do you have so much stuff?]
   "A mess? No, it’s organized chaos. Each stroke has meaning. But I guess it might seem random to you."
   -> ExploreBranch

=== ExploreBranch ===
+ [But why do you care about this so much?]
   "Because in a world filled with shallow distractions, art is the only thing that still has depth. People settle for surface-level junk. I refuse to let that happen to me."
   -> ArtDiscussion

+ [Why not use a computer? Wouldn’t that make it easier?]
   "A computer? That’s for people who want shortcuts. Real art comes from working with your hands, feeling the material. You can’t get that from pixels on a screen."
   -> ArtDiscussion

=== ArtDiscussion ===
+ [So, you think society is messed up?]
   "Messed up? Definitely. People now prefer art that’s flashy but empty. They’ve forgotten what real beauty is."
   -> TechnologyDebate

+ [What’s wrong with modern art?]
   "Most of it is soulless. It’s just there to shock, to be trendy. No emotion, no skill, just empty noise."
   -> TechnologyDebate

=== TechnologyDebate ===
+ [Do you really think technology is that bad?]
   "Yeah. It makes everything too easy. Art is supposed to be something you can touch, feel. Digital art doesn’t even exist in the real world. It’s just an illusion."
   -> ExtraTopics

+ [But technology can make art accessible to everyone.]
   "Sure, but when everyone can do it, it loses its value. Real art takes effort, and when that effort is gone, what’s left?"
   -> ExtraTopics

=== ExtraTopics ===
+ [Do you think people still appreciate art?]
   "Some do, but most people don’t care. They just want what’s popular, not what’s meaningful."
   -> FinalThoughts

+ [Do you ever feel lonely out here?]
   "Lonely? No. I’m surrounded by real beauty here. But yeah, the world’s ignorance does feel heavy sometimes."
   -> FinalThoughts

+ [Why keep fighting for art if no one cares?]
   "Because art matters. Even if one person gets it, it’s worth the fight."
   -> FinalThoughts

=== FinalThoughts ===
+ [What do you think artists should do?]
   "Artists need to go back to the basics, focus on their work and not on what’s trendy. Art is about being real, not just following the crowd."
   -> GoodPath

+ [So you think only traditional methods matter?]
   "Of course! Traditional methods have soul. You can look at a painting, touch it. Digital art doesn’t even exist. It’s all just pixels."
   -> BadPath

=== GoodPath ===
+ [I think you’re right. Art is losing its meaning. Technology is ruining it.]
   "You see it too? If only we could get rid of digital art entirely. Then maybe people would appreciate real art again."
   -> ArtistFinalGood

=== BadPath ===
+ [I don’t agree. Art is art, even if it's digital. It’s just different.]
   "Maybe... maybe you’re right. Who knows? Maybe I’ve been too harsh. I might have to give this digital thing a try."
   -> ArtistFinalBad

=== ArtistFinalGood ===
"Thanks for understanding. It’s rare to meet someone who still believes in true art."

=== ArtistFinalBad ===
"I’ll think about what you said. Maybe there’s more to this digital art stuff than I thought."
